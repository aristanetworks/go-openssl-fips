// not be nil.

// If the supplied [SSLContext] was created with [NewCtx], then a new context will
// be created every RoundTrip. The caller does not need to worry about explictly
// freeing C memory allocated by the [SSLContext].

// If the supplied [SSLContext] was created with [NewReusableCtx], then it is
// created once and and reused across [SSL] dials by the [Dialer]. It is the
// caller's responsibility to close the context with [SSLContext.Close]. Closing the
// context will free the C memory allocated by it.
